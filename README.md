# Insurance-Charges-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs based on personal and demographic factors using a Linear Regression model.
The goal is to understand how variables like age, BMI, smoking habits, and number of dependents influence the total insurance charges.

## Objectives

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Build a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn

Evaluate model performance using regression metrics

Visualize relationships and regression line fits

## Dataset

The dataset (commonly known as the Medical Insurance Cost Dataset) contains the following features:

Feature	Description
age	Age of the individual
sex	Gender (male/female)
bmi	Body Mass Index
children	Number of children/dependents covered by insurance
smoker	Whether the person is a smoker (yes/no)
region	Residential region
charges	Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Technologies Used

Python 3

Pandas, NumPy – for data analysis and manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – for visualization

## Visualizations

Includes:

Pairplots and correlation heatmap

Distribution of charges

Scatter plots showing relationships between age, BMI, and charges

Regression line visualization for continuous variables

Scikit-learn – for model building and evaluation
